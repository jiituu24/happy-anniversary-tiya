                My Dearest Love,
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                As I sit here writing this letter, my heart is overflowing with so much love for you that words seem inadequate. One year ago, you walked into my life and changed everything. You turned my ordinary days into extraordinary adventures and filled my world with colors I never knew existed.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Every morning I wake up grateful for another day to love you. Your smile is my favorite sunrise, your laughter is my favorite melody, and your love is my favorite blessing. You've taught me that home isn't a place ‚Äì it's the feeling I get when I'm with you.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                I love the way you scrunch your nose when you laugh, how you always steal my hoodies (and look incredibly cute in them), and how you make even the simplest moments feel magical. I love your kind heart, your brilliant mind, and the way you believe in me even when I don't believe in myself.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                This past year has been the most beautiful chapter of my life. Through every joy, every challenge, every quiet moment, and every exciting adventure, you've been my constant. You've been my partner, my best friend, my safe place, and my greatest love.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                I promise to love you through all the seasons of our life together. I promise to hold your hand through every storm and dance with you in every ray of sunshine. I promise to choose you, every single day, for all the days of my life.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Thank you for loving me so completely, for accepting all of me ‚Äì the good, the silly, and the imperfect. Thank you for being the most incredible girlfriend, partner, and best friend I could ever ask for.
              </p>

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Here's to our first year, and to all the beautiful years ahead of us. I can't wait to create more memories, share more dreams, and fall even deeper in love with you.
              </p>

              <p className="text-xl leading-relaxed font-light mt-8 text-primary">
