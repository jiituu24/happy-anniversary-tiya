              </p>

              <p>
                I Love u babe, I still remember the 1st day i came to meet you. That day changed everything. till then whenever I've seen you, i just think "How did i get you, So perfect, cute hot and my type". From that time i have visited you many times, and everytime felt like you're a blessing for me. Each time i leave i just know one thing that u r mine. Yes, we fight (infact last 2 days ka jaan k kia tha), we argue, But at the end of the day, we never give up on each other. i heard perfection doesn't exist - But then i met you. Love is about reshaping again and again, fitting into each other's worlds, and still choosing to stay. and for me, leaving you has never been, and will never be, an option. you care for me like my mother, you stand with me in my career, you hold me strong in my weak moments. You are my safe place, my best friend, My soulmate, ,you're my constant. You're my ideal person. My love, my heart my everything-you are already the best. And if i had to live a thousand lives, I would still find you in each one.
              </p>
